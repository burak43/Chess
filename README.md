## Regarding the project ##

Our project is a chess game, with potential additions to the regular chess game we have in mind 
(like randomly taking out pieces, concealing the types of two or three pieces of each player 
-preferably one of them includes the king or the queen-,  forcing players to decide within a tight time frame, 
or giving certain boosts to them). This software is used for both entertainment and brain-boosting purposes.
